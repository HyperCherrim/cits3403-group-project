## Application Summary 

Utilising Flask, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap to create a seamless and coherent study group experience.

## Launch Instructions: 
Before first launch, the database must be initialised to avoid errors.  To do this, enter the `Backend` directory and execute `flask db upgrade` to populate a new (empty) database file.  
After the database file has been created (check `app/` for a file named `appDatabase.db`), the app can be executed using `flask run`, also from the `Backend` folder.
### Note regarding launching from the ZIP file
- These instructions may differ based on how the submission is packaged - these instructions are for running the app from the Git repo.

## Running Tests

Currently no tests - these will be covered shortly.
