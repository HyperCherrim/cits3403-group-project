- Hook up the DB
- Account page?

- Pushing/Pulling to-from the DB
	- Write a function that returns a string - then 

- Adding methods of sending/receiving information from the server
	- Might also be relevant for the homepage since that will require the server to list off a bunch of groups
	- Set time to be loaded from the server?

- - When first loading the `index` page, pull the fixe newest study groups?
	- Then use the `search` function for more relevant stuffs


- Once loading from DB is covered, that'll be when everything can be linked together and lead to a (somewhat) finished product



- Dates: Stored as a "ridiculously long string o' horrors" (according to Callum)
	- Python script to format it correctly?
	- Check for time overlaps

- Words are hard - which is why this document is so scattered...
