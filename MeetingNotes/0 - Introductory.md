## Planning
- Deciding basic elements of the website (eg. colours, theming)
- Begin planning of what the website is going to look like

## 3:05pm - Set up the GitHub repo

## Delegation of Tasks
- Idea: People are allocated roles, yet there may be bleedover?
## Planning

Task: A requestform application - allows users to create accounts, post requests and answer other people's requests

- Deliverables: 
	- Initial HTML/CSS setup (nonfunctional - mockup)
- Figure out the order of jobs later

## Requirements
- Dynamic page where requests can be made/answered
- Must also allow other people to see the requests

- HTML Pages for making (and responding to) requests, alongside accounts
- CSS: Supporting HTML
- JavaScript to provide the dynamic stuff and to make it work
- SQLite - database (eg. accounts, storing requests)
- JQuery/Flask

## Selection of brief:

- Scheduler/Event Organiser
- Puzzle/Answer - ratio?


### Idea One:
- Study group system
	- Search for specific groups by unit, maybe by project.

## Selected idea: Study Group system

- Tags for specific units
- (note) At the end, some other ideas could be explored


## Decomposition

- Account details page
### Initial Request
- Thought: What do we need for hit?
- Title, description, proposed time/dates(?), 
- Tags - allow all relevant requests to be shown to the user

### Answering:
- List of the options
- Answer w/ available times
	- Subset of original times
- Message to the group leader stating an expression of interest (maybe at the end?)

### Account:
- Username and password
- Student ID?, Email address?
- (maybe later) Tags?
- Restrict forum activities for anons?
- Password security - covered later
	- Job for Flask? (This will have to be put on hold until Flask is covered)

### Other
- 404 page

## This Week:
- Making the placeholder pages
- Basic CSS
- Continue to plot ideas
