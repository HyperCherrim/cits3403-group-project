- Minor error: The request-HTML work was done by Callum - for some reason it showed up as being merged from my account.


## Progress so far:
- Started on HTML (request, home, user accounts etc.)
	- Will need refinement later, but we have a baseline


## This Week:
- CSS?
	- Bootstrap
- Basic JavaScript? (functions that don't require external dependencies)
	- Required: 
		- Testing for valid passwords
		- Making/Responding: Time Implementation (allowing to specify available times)

- Currently waiting on server-side functionality (not covered yet as on 8/04)

- Write down everything that can be done (as of 8/04) and then breaking down into what to do over the week

- Other JS that can currently be done?
	- Homepage: JS for options (not currently an option due to reqs for database)

- Time selector - also requires DB, so may also have to hang fire for a bit
	- However, the baseline function may be able to be built


## Proposed Goal:
- CSS and Bootstrap implementation

- Plan the database backend (potentially)
-

- Deal with citations later

- Callum - DB Planning
- Nathan - CSS for account operation pages + bit of JS?
- Krish - CSS for request (making/replying) pages
- Myself (Atticus) - Navbar fixing and general rollout

## Site Style

- Search: Account Name, Group Title, Group Tags
- Topsearch - maybe search by group name?
- <span style=color:orange>will be covered once we get to search</span>


- Group organiser specifies range of times
- Person replying specifies a range *within* the selected range

- White space - initial person specifies unavailable
- Green space - all people available
- Orange space - some available, some unavailable
	- Group organiser - hard setting

- Min/max thresholds for groups at specified times

- Confirmation - email?


- Also required: adding tags (to add to the db.)
